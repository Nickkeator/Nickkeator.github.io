I've had a lifelong interest in electronics, building computers from a young age. After high school, I attended a trade school for automotive, diesel, and industrial repair, gaining significant experience with mechanical systems. However, I eventually realized that I wanted a career focused on designing solutions rather than just repairing them. This led me to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering, where my previous experience proved invaluable and sparked an interest in the intersection of mechanical engineering and computation.

In my free time I play video games, attend car races, ride bicycles, set up servers, and work on electronics projects.
